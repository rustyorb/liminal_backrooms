# No-Brainer User-Facing Improvements

Five low-risk, high-value enhancements that would make the app feel smoother for new and returning users.

1. **First-Run Setup Wizard**  
   Detect missing API keys or fonts and guide the user through adding them (with links to providers and validation). This prevents the "silent fail" on first launch and reduces support questions.

2. **Scenario + Model Presets**  
   Offer one-click "starter kits" (e.g., Classic Backrooms with balanced models, Dystopian Ad Agency with high-creativity temperature). Surface them in the launcher so users can get to a fun run without hand-tuning five dropdowns.

3. **Inline Command Helper**  
   Add a collapsible cheat sheet in the chat pane for `!image`, `!video`, `!search`, `!add_ai`, etc., with copy-to-clipboard examples. This lowers the learning curve and reminds users what the bots can do mid-session.

4. **Autosave & Resume Sessions**  
   Automatically save conversation state, prompts, and generated media to a named session file, with a "Resume last session" button on launch. Users can drop back into experiments without re-entering config.

5. **Media Gallery Tab**  
   Provide a dedicated tab showing all generated images/videos with metadata (prompt, model, timestamp) and quick export. This makes visual outputs easy to review and share without scrolling through the whole transcript.
